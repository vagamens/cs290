		<h3>Self-Summary</h3><table>
		<p>I am a self-tought programmer currently studying to complete by degree in Computer Science. I enjoy gaming, electronics photography and playing the piano though I am not very good yet).</p>
		<h3>What I'm doing with my life</h3>
		<p>I am working on my CS degree at OSU and LBCC.</p>
		<p>I have begun working on my own consulting company so that I can be my own boss and work on whichevery projects I find to be most interesting</p>
		<p>I have plans to buy my own house after I graduate. Not quite sure what I want in a house, but I want something that will house not just my family, but also my business as I plan to work mostly from home.</p>
		<h3>I'm really good at</h3>
		<p>As might be expected from my CS major, I am a problem solver. i'm pretty alright at photography in that I can take a good-looking picture of just about anything.</p>
		<p>I am very good at over-thinking everything. Give me something interesting to think about, and I will over0thin the problem until I have either solved it, or found no solution.</p>
		<p>I mostly take pictures of landscapes. one of my favorite locations to photograph is Alsea Falls, which on its own is worth the drive to get to and from. I also enjoy getting photographs of South Santiam pass especially between late fall and early spring. The snow on the trees with the road between them looks amazing in person and make for quite a nice desktop background, especially at work.</p>
