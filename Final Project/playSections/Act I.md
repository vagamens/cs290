# Act I

## Scene II

[At sea on a boat]

[Enter Viola, a Captain, and Sailors]

**Viola**:   What country, friends, is this?

**Captain**: This is Illyria, lady.

**Viola**:   And what should I do in Illyria?
			 My brother he is in Elysium.
			 Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?

**Captain**: It is perchance that you yourself were saved.

**Viola**:   O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.

**Captain**: True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
			 Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
			 When you and those poor number saved with you
			 Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
			 Most provident in peril, bind himself,
			 Courage and hope both teaching him the practice,
			 To a string mast that lived upon the sea;
			 Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
			 I saw him hold acquaintance with the waved
			 So long as I could see.

**Viola**:	 For saying so, there's gold:
			 Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
			 Where to thy speech serves for authority,
			 The like of him. Know'st thou this country?

**Captain**: Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
			 Not three hours' travel from this very place.

**Viola**:	 Who governs here?

**Captain**: A noble duke, in nature as in name.

**Viola**:	 What is the name?

**Captain**: Orsino.

**Viola**:	 Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
			 He was a bachelor then.

**Captain**: And so is  now, or was so very late;
			 For but a month ago I went from hence,
			 And then 'twas freshin murmur, -- as, you know,
			 What great ones do the less will prattle of, --
			 That he did seek the love of fiar Olivia.

**Viola**:	 What's she?

**Captain**: A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
			 That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
			 In the protection of his son, her brother,
			 Who shortly also dies: for whose dear love,
			 They say, she hath abjured the company
			 And sight of men.

**Viola**:	 O that I served that lady
			 And might not be delivered to the world,
			 Till I made mine own occasion mellow,
			 What my estate is!

**Captain**: That were hard to compass;
			 Because she will admit no kind of suit,
			 No, not the duke's.

**Viola**:	 There is a fiar behavior in thee, captain;
			 And though that nature with a beauteous wall
			 Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
			 I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
			 With this thy fair and outward character,
			 I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
			 Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
			 For such disguise as haply shall become
			 The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
			 Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
			 It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
			 And speak to him in many sorts of music
			 That will allow him in many sorts of music
			 That will allow me very worth his service.
			 What else may hap to time I will commit;
			 Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.

**Captain**: Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
			 When my tounge blabs, then let mine eyes not see.

**Viola**:	 I thank thee: lead me on.

## Secne IV

[Duke Orsino's palace]

[Enter Valentine and Viola in man's attire]

**Valentine**:	If theduke continue theses favours towards you,
				Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath
				known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.

**Viola**:		You either fear his humour or my negligence, that
				you call in question the continuance of his love:
				is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?

**Valentine**:	No, believe me.

**Viola**:		I thank you. Here comes the count

[Enter Duke Orsino, Curio, and Attendants]

**Orsino**:		Who saw Cesario, ho?

**Viola**:		On you attendance, my lord; here.

**Orsino**:		Stand you awhile aloof, Cesario,
				Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
				To thee the book even of my secrel soul:
				Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
				Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
				And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
				Till thou have audience.

**Viola**:		Sure, my noble lord,
				If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
				As it is spoke, she never will admit me.

**Orsino**:		Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
				Rather thn make unprofited return.

**Viola**:		Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?

**Orsino**:		O, then unfold the passion of my love,
				Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
				It shall become thee will to act my woes;
				She will attend it better in thy youth
				Than in a nunvio's of more grave aspect.

**Viola**:		I think not so, my lord.

**Orsino**:		Dear lad, believe it;
				For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
				That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
				Is not more smooth and rubious; they small pipe
				Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
				And all is semblative a woman's part.
				I know thy constellation is right apt
				For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
				All, if you will; for I myself am best
				When least in company. Prosper will in this,
				And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
				To call his fortunes thine.

**Viola**:		I'll do my best
				To woo your lady:
				[Aside]
				Yet, a barful strife!
				Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.

## Scene V

### Rewrite from Viola's perspective

[Olivia's house]

[Enter Maria and Clown(Feste)]

**Maria**:	Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will
			not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
			way of thy excuse: my lady will hange thee for they absence.

**Feste**:	Let her hange me: he that is well hanged in this
			world need to fear no colours.

**Maria**:	Make that good.

**Feste**:	He shell see none to fear.

**Maria**:	A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that
			saying was bor, of 'I fear no colours'

**Feste**:	Where, good Misstress Mary?

**Maria**:	In the wars; an that may you be bold to say in your foolery.

**Feste**:	Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those
			that are fools, let them use their talents.

**Maria**:	Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,
			to be turned away, is not that as good as hanging to you?

**Feste**:	Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,
			for turning away, let summer bear it out.

**Maria**:	You are resolute, then?

**Feste**:	Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.

**Maria**:	That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both
			break, your gaskins fall.

**Feste**:	Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, to thy way; if
			Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a
			piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.

**Maria**;	Peace, you rouge, no more o' that. Here come my
			layd; make your excuse wisely, wer were best.[Exit]

**Feste**:	Wit, an't by thy will, put me into good fooling!
			Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft
			prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may
			pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
			'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'
			[Enter Olivia with Malvolio]
			God bless thee, lady!

**Olivia**:	Take the fool away.

**Feste**:	Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.

**Olivia**:	Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:
			besides, you grow dishonest

**Feste**:	Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel
			will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is
			the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend
			himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if
			he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything
			that's mended is but patched: virtue that
			transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that
			amends is but patched with virute. If that this
			simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will no,
			what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
			calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take
			away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.

**Olivia**:	Sir, I bade them take you away.

**Feste**:	Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non
			facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not
			motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to 
			prove you a fool.

**Olivia**:	Can you do it?

**Feste**:	Dexterously, good madonna.

**Olivia**:	Make your proof.

**Feste**:	I must cateschise you for it, madonna: good my mouse
			of virtue, anser me.

**Olivia**:	Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.

**Feste**:	Good madonna, why mournest thou?

**Olivia**:	Good fool, for my brother's death.

**Feste**:	I think his soul is in hell, madonna.

**Olivia**:	I know his soul is in heaven, fool.

**Feste**:	The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's
			soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.

**Olivia**:	What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he no mend?

**Malvolio**:	Yes, and do till the pangs of death shake him:
				infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the
				better fool.

**Feste**:		God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the
				better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
				sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his
				word for two pence that you are no fool.

**Olivia**:		How say you to that, Malvolio?

**Malvolio**:	I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
				barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
				with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
				than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard
				already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to
				him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,
				that crow so that these set kind of fools, no better
				than the fools' zanies.

[Enter Olivia, Feste, Maria]

**Olivia**: Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.
			We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.

[Enter Viola and Attendants]

**Viola**:	The honorable lady of the house, which is she?

**Olivia**:	Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
			Your will?

**Viola**:	Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty, -- I
			pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
			for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
			my speech, for beside that it is excellently well
			penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
			beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
			comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
