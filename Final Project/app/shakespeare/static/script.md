# Act I

## Scene I

[At sea on a boat]

[Enter Viola, a Captain, and Sailors]

**Viola**:   What country, friends, is this?

**Captain**: This is Illyria, lady.

**Viola**:   And what should I do in Illyria?
			 My brother he is in Elysium.
			 Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?

**Captain**: It is perchance that you yourself were saved.

**Viola**:   O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.

**Captain**: True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
			 Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
			 When you and those poor number saved with you
			 Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
			 Most provident in peril, bind himself,
			 Courage and hope both teaching him the practice,
			 To a string mast that lived upon the sea;
			 Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
			 I saw him hold acquaintance with the waved
			 So long as I could see.

**Viola**:	 For saying so, there's gold:
			 Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
			 Where to thy speech serves for authority,
			 The like of him. Know'st thou this country?

**Captain**: Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
			 Not three hours' travel from this very place.

**Viola**:	 Who governs here?

**Captain**: A noble duke, in nature as in name.

**Viola**:	 What is the name?

**Captain**: Orsino.

**Viola**:	 Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
			 He was a bachelor then.

**Captain**: And so is  now, or was so very late;
			 For but a month ago I went from hence,
			 And then 'twas freshin murmur, -- as, you know,
			 What great ones do the less will prattle of, --
			 That he did seek the love of fiar Olivia.

**Viola**:	 What's she?

**Captain**: A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
			 That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
			 In the protection of his son, her brother,
			 Who shortly also dies: for whose dear love,
			 They say, she hath abjured the company
			 And sight of men.

**Viola**:	 O that I served that lady
			 And might not be delivered to the world,
			 Till I made mine own occasion mellow,
			 What my estate is!

**Captain**: That were hard to compass;
			 Because she will admit no kind of suit,
			 No, not the duke's.

**Viola**:	 There is a fiar behavior in thee, captain;
			 And though that nature with a beauteous wall
			 Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
			 I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
			 With this thy fair and outward character,
			 I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
			 Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
			 For such disguise as haply shall become
			 The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
			 Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
			 It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
			 And speak to him in many sorts of music
			 That will allow him in many sorts of music
			 That will allow me very worth his service.
			 What else may hap to time I will commit;
			 Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.

**Captain**: Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
			 When my tounge blabs, then let mine eyes not see.

**Viola**:	 I thank thee: lead me on.

## Secne II

[Duke Orsino's palace]

[Enter Valentine and Cesario in man's attire]

**Valentine**:	If the duke continue theses favurs towards you,
				Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath
				known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.

**Cesario**:		You either fear his humour or my negligence, that
				you call in question the continuance of his love:
				is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?

**Valentine**:	No, believe me.

**Cesario**:		I thank you. Here comes the count

[Enter Duke Orsino, Curio, and Attendants]

**Orsino**:		Who saw Cesario, ho?

**Cesario**:		On you attendance, my lord; here.

**Orsino**:		Stand you awhile aloof, Cesario,
				Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
				To thee the book even of my secrel soul:
				Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
				Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
				And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
				Till thou have audience.

**Cesario**:		Sure, my noble lord,
				If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
				As it is spoke, she never will admit me.

**Orsino**:		Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
				Rather thn make unprofited return.

**Cesario**:		Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?

**Orsino**:		O, then unfold the passion of my love,
				Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
				It shall become thee will to act my woes;
				She will attend it better in thy youth
				Than in a nunvio's of more grave aspect.

**Cesario**:		I think not so, my lord.

**Orsino**:		Dear lad, believe it;
				For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
				That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
				Is not more smooth and rubious; they small pipe
				Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
				And all is semblative a woman's part.
				I know thy constellation is right apt
				For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
				All, if you will; for I myself am best
				When least in company. Prosper will in this,
				And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
				To call his fortunes thine.

**Cesario**:		I'll do my best
				To woo your lady:
				[Aside]
				Yet, a barful strife!
				Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.

## Scene III

[Courtyard at Olivia's]()

[Enter Cesario, Maria, Sir Toby and Soldiers]()

**Sir Toby**:	Halt! Who would enter my Lady's courtyard?

**Cesario**:	A man who comes in envoy to speak with your Lady.

**Sir Toby**:	[To Maria] Go and tell your Lady of this man's arrival.
				[To Cesario] From whence have you come, sir?

**Cesario**:	From a land filled with many fine things

**Sir Toby**:	Why be it that you com so well attained?

[Enter Maria and Malvolio]()

**Cesario**:	To show my proprietor's ability to those he trusts.

[Exit Sir Toby]()

**Malvolio**:	Good sir, I would welcome you my Lady's court,
				But she would know from whense you came.

**Cesario**:	I come from the land Illyria.

**Malvolio**:	Do you bring suit from the count?

**Cesario**:	I bring his goodwill and a message well crafted.

**Malvolio**:	My Lady will not hear the suit from Orsino.

**Cesario**:	I needs must deliver my message which has been so well crafted.

**Malvolio**:	My Lady has heard many these suits and will not hear another.

[Re-enter Sir Toby]()

**Cesario**:	I bring not a suit, but a plea. That is, to speak with your Lady.

**Malvolio**:	You will not go then?

**Cesario**:	No, sir. I will not go.

[Exit Malvolio and Maria]()

**Sir Toby**:	Will you stay 'till morn? Or will you depart by night?

**Cesario**:	If your Lady hears me well, I shall be on the way by morn.

**Sir Toby**:	Then there shal be sac tonight, if you be there.

[Enter Malvolio]()

**Malvolio**:	My Lady would see you, sir.

**Cesario**:	I thank thee: lead me on, sir.

[Exit All]

## Scene IV

[Olivia's house]

[Enter Olivia, Cesario and Attendants]

**Cesario**:	The honorable lady of the house, which is she?

**Olivia**:	Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
			Your will?

**Cesario**:	Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty, -- I
			pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
			for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
			my speech, for beside that it is excellently well
			penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
			beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
			comptible, even to the least sinister usage.

**Olivia**:	Whence came you, sir?

**Cesario**:	I can say little more than I have studied, and that
			question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
			modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,
			that I may proceed in my speech.

**Olivia**:	Are you a comedian?

**Cesario**:	No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs
			of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you
			the lady of the house?

**Olivia**:	If I do not ursurp myself, I am.

**Cesario**:	Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
			youself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours
			to reserver. But this is from my commission: I will
			on with my speech in your praise, and then show you
			the heart of my message.

**Olivia**:	Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.

**Cesario**:	Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.

**Olivia**:	It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,
			keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,
			and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
			than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if
			you have reason, be breif: 'tis not that time of
			moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.

**Maria**:	Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.

**Cesario**:	No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little
			longer. Some mollification for you giant, sweet
			lady. Tell me your min: I am a messenger.

**Olivia**:	Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when
			the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.

**Cesario**:	It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
			war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my
			hand, my words are as fun of peace as matter.

**Olivia**:	Yet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?

**Cesario**:	The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
			learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
			would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,
			divinity, to any other's profanation.

**Olivia**:	Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.
			[Exeunt Maria and Attentants]
			Now, sir, what is your text?

**Cesario**:	Most sweet lady, --

**Olivia**:	A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
			Where lies your heart?

**Cesario**:	In Orsino's bosom.

**Olivai**:	In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?

**Cesario**:	To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.

**Olivia**:	O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?

**Cesario**:	Good madam, let me see your face.

**Olivia**:	Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
			with my face? You are now out of your text: but
			we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
			Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't
			not well done?

[Unveiling]

**Cesario**:	Excellently done, if God did all.

**Olivia**:	'Tis in grain, sir, 'twill endure wind and weather.

**Cesario**:	'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
			Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
			Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
			If you will lead these graces to the grave
			And leave the work do copy.

**Olivia**:	O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give
			out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
			inventoried, and every particle and utensil
			labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
			indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to
			them; item, one nech, one chin, and so forth. Were
			you sent hither to praise me?

**Cesario**:	I see you what you are, you are too proud;
			But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
			My lod and master loves you: O, such love
			Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd
			The nonpareil of beauty!

**Olivia**:	How does he love me?

**Cesario**:	With adorations, fertile tears,
			With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.

**Olivia**:	Your lord dies know my mind; I cannot love him:
			Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
			Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
			In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;
			ANd in dimension and the shape of nature
			A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
			He might have took his answer long ago.

**Cesario**:	If I did love you in my master's flame,
			With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
			In you denial I would find no sense;
			I would not understand it.

**Olivia**:	Why, what would you?

**Cesario**:	Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
			And call upon my soul within the house;
			Write loyal cantons of contemned love
			And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
			Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
			And make the babbling gossip of the air
			Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest
			Between the elements of air and earth,
			But you should pity me!

**Olivia**:	You might do much.
			What is your parentage?

**Cesario**:	Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
			I am a gentleman.

**Olivia**:	Get you to your lord;
			I cannot love him: let him send no more;
			Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
			To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
			I thank you for your pains: spend this for me

[Olivia hands Cesario a coin]

**Cesario**:	I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
			My master, not myself, lack recompense.
			Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
			And let your fervor, like my master's, be
			Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.

[Exit]

# Act II

## Scene I

[A street]()

[Enter Cesario, Malvolio following]()

**Malvolio**:	Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?

**Cesario**:		Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since
				arrive but hither.

**Malvolio**:	She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have
				saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.
				She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord
				into a desperate assurnace she will none of him:
				and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to
				come again in his affairs, unless it be to report
				your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.

**Cesario**:		She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.

**Malvolio**:	Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her
				will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth
				stooping for, there is lies in your eye; if not, be
				it his that finds it.

[Malvolio throws ring on ground]()

[Exit Malvolio]()

**Cesario**:		I left no ring with her: what means this lady?
				Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
				She made good view of me, indeed, so much,
				That sure methought her eyes has lost her tounge,
				For she did speak in starts distractedly.
				She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion
				Invites me in this churlish messenger.
				None of my lord's ring! Why, he sent her none.
				I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis
				Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
				Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,
				Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
				How easy is it for the proper-false
				In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
				Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
				For such as we are made of, such we be.
				How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly;
				And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
				And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
				What will become of this? As i am man,
				My state is desperate for my master's love;
				As I am woman, -- now alas the day! --
				What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
				Oh time! though must untangle this, not I:
				It is too hard a know for me to untie!

[Exit Cesario]()

## Scene II

[Duke Orsino's palace]()

[Enter Duke Orsino, Cesario, Curio, and others]()

**Orsino**:	Give moe some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
			Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
			That old and antique song we heard last night:
			Methought it did relieve my passion much,
			More than light airs and recollected terms
			Of these most brisk and gidd-paced times:
			Come, but one verse.

**Curio**:	He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.

**Orsino**:	Who was it?

**Curio**:	Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady
			Olivia's fater took much delight in. He is about the house.

**Orsino**:	Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
			[Exit Curio, Music plays]()
			Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,
			In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
			For such as I am all true lovers are,
			Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,
			Save in the constant image of the createure
			That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?

**Cesario**:	It give a very echo to the seat
			Where Love is throned.

**Orsino**:	Thou dost speak masterly:
			My life upon't, you though thou aret, thine eye
			Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:
			Hath it not, boy?

**Cesario**:	A little, by your favour.

**Orsino**:	What kind of woman is't?

**Cesario**:	Of your complexion.

**Orsino**:	She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?

**Cesario**:	About your years, my lord.

**Orsino**:	Too old by heaven: let still the woman take
			An elder than herself: so wears she to him,
			So sways she level in her husband's hears.
			For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
			Our fancies are more guddy and unfirm,
			More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
			Than women's are.

**Cesario**:	I think it well, my lord.

**Orsino**:	Then let love be younger than thyself,
			Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
			For women are as roses, whose fair flower
			Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.

**Cesario**:	And so they are: alas, that are so;
			To die, even when they to perfection grow!

[Re-ender Curio and Clown]()

**Orsino**:	O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.
			Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;
			The spinsters and the knotters in the sun
			And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
			Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
			And dallies with the innocence of love,
			Like the old age.

**Feste**:	Are you ready, sir?

**Orsino**:	Ay; prithee, sing.
			[Music]()

**Feste**:	Come away, come away, death,
			And in sad cypress let me be laid;
			Fly away, fly away breath;
			I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
			My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
			O, prepare it!
			My part of death, no one so true
			Did share it.
			Not a flower, not a flower sweet
			On my black coffin let there be strown;
			Not a friend, not a friend greet
			My poort corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:
			A thousand thousand sighs to save,
			Lay me, O, where
			Sad true lover never find my grave,
			To weep there!

**Orsino**:	There's for thy pains.

**Feste**:	No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.

**Orsino**:	I'll pay thy pleasure then.

**Feste**:	Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.

**Orsino**:	Give me now leave to leave thee.

**Feste**:	Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the
			tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta,
			thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
			constancy put to sea, that their business might be
			every thing and their intent every where; for that's
			it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.

[Exit Feste]()

**Orsino**:	Let all the rest give place.
			[Curio and Attendants retire]()
			Once more, Cesario,
			Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
			Tell her, my love, more moble than the world,
			Prizes not quantity of ditry lands;
			The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,
			Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
			But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
			That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.

**Cesario**:	But if she cannot love you, sir?

**Orsino**:	I cannot be so answer'd.

**Cesario**:	Sooth, but you must.
			Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
			Hath for you love a great a pang of heart
			As you have for Olivia: you cannot lover her;
			You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?

**Orsino**:	There is no woman's sides
			Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
			As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
			So big, to hold so much; they lack retention
			Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,
			No motion of the liver, but the palate,
			That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;
			But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
			And can digest as much: make no compare
			Between that love a woman can bear me
			And that I owe Olivia.

**Cesario**:	Ay, but I know --

**Orsino**:	What does thou know?

**Cesario**:	Too well that love women to men may owe:
			In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
			My fater had a daughter loved a man,
			As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
			I should your lordship.

**Orsino**:	And what's her history?

**Cesario**:	A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
			But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
			Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in though,
			And with a green and yellow melancholy
			She sat like patience on a monument,
			Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
			We men may say more, swear more: but indeed
			Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
			Much in our vows, but little in our love.

**Orsino**:	But died thy sister of her love, my boy?

**Cesario**:	I am all the daughters of my father's house,
			And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.
			Sir, shall I to this lady?

**Orsino**:	Ay, that's the theme.
			To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,
			My love can give no place, bide no denay.

[Exeunt]()

# Act III

## Scene I

[Olivia's garden]()

[Enter Cesario, and Clown with a tabour]()

**Cesario**:	Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by
			thy tabour?

**Feste**:	No, sir, I live by the church.

**Cesario**:	Art thou a churchman?

**Feste**:	No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for
			I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by
			the church.

**Cesario**:	So thou mayst say, the king lies by a begger, if a
			beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy
			tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.

**Feste**:	You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is
			but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
			wrong side my be turned outward.

**Cesario**:	Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with
			words may quickly make them wanton.

**Feste**:	I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.

**Cesario**:	Why, man?

**Feste**:	Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that
			word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words
			are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.

**Cesario**:	Thy reason, man?

**Feste**:	Troth, sir, I can yield you non without words; and
			words are grown so false, I am loath to prove
			reason with them.

**Cesario**:	I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.

**Feste**:	No so, sir I do care for something; but in my
			conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be
			to care for nothing, sir, I would make you invisible.

**Cesario**:	Art thou the Lady Olivia's fool?

**Feste**:	No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she
			will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and
			fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
			herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not
			her fool, but her corrupter of words.

**Cesario**:	I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.

**Feste**:	Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,
			it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but
			the fool should be as oft with your master as with
			my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.

**Cesario**:	Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.
			Hold, there's expenses for thee.

**Feste**:	Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!

**Cesario**:	By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sock for
			one;
			[Aside]()
			though I would not have it grown on my chin.
			[To Feste]()
			Is thy lady within?

**Feste**:	Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?

**Cesario**:	Yes, being kept together and put to use.

**Feste**:	I would play Lord Pandarus of Phyrygia, sir, to bring
			a Cressida to this Troilus

**Cesario**:	I understand you, sir; 'tis will begged.

**Feste**:	The matter, I hope, is not greate, sir, begging but
			a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is
			within, sir. I will construe to them whence you
			come; who you are and what you would are out of my
			welkin, I might say 'element', but the word is over-worn.

[Exit Feste]()

**Cesario**:	This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
			And to do that well craves a kind of with:
			He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
			The quality of persons, and the time,
			And, like the hagard, cheque at every feather
			That comes before his eye. THis is a practise
			As full of labour as a wise man's art
			For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
			But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.

[Enter Sir Toby Belch, and Sir Andrew]()

**Sir Toby Belch**:			Save you, gentleman,

**Cesario**:					And you, sir.

**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	Dieu vous garde, monsieur.

**Cesario**:					Et vous assi; votre serviteur.

**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.

**Sir Toby Belch**:			Will you encounter the house? My neive is desirous
							you should enter, if you trade be to her.

**Cesario**:					I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the
							list of my voyage.

**Sir Toby Belch**:			I mean, to go, sir, to enter.

**Cesario**:					I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we
							are prevented.
							[Enter Olivia and Maria]()
							Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain
							odours on you!

**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	That youth's a rare cortuer: 'Rain odours;' well.

**Cesario**:					My matter hath no voice, to your own mast prgnant
							and vouchsafed ear.

**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em
							all three al ready.

**Olivia**:					Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.
							[Exeunt Toby, Andrew and Maria]
							Give me your hand, sir.

**Cesario**:					My duty, madam, and most humble service.

**Olivia**:					What is your name?

**Cesario**:					Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.

**Olivia**:					My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world
							Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:
							You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.

**Cesario**:					And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:
							Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.

**Olivia**:					For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,
							Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!

**Cesario**:					Madam, I come to whet you gentle thoughts
							On his behalf.

**Olivia**:					O, by your leave, I pray you,
							I bade you never speak again of him;
							But, would you undertake another suit,
							I had rather hear you to solicit that
							Than music from the spheres.

**Cesario**:					Dear lady, --

**Olivia**:					Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,
							After the last enchantment you did here,
							A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
							Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:
							Under your hard construction must I sit,
							To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
							Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
							Have you not set mine honour at the stake
							And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
							That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
							Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,
							Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.

**Cesario**:					I pity you.

**Olivia**:					That's a degree to love.

**Cesario**:					No, not a grize: for 'tis a vulgar proof,
							That very oft we pity enemies.

**Olivia**:					Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.
							O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
							If one should be a prey, how much the better
							To fail before the lion than the wolf?
							[Clock strikes]
							The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
							Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:
							And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
							You were is alike to reap a proper man:
							There lies your way, due west.

**Cesario**:					Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition
							Attend your ladyship!
							You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?

**Olivia**:					Stay.
							I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.

**Cesario**:					That you do think you are not what you are.

**Olivia**:					If I think so, I think the same of you.

**Cesario**:					Then think you right: I am not what I am.

**Olivia**:					I would you were as I would have you be!

**Cesario**:					Would it be better, madam, than I am?
							I wish it might, for now I am your fool.

**Olivia**:					O, what a deal of scorn look beautuful
							In the contempt and anger of his lip!
							A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
							Than love that would seem hid: live's night is noon.
							Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
							By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,
							I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
							Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
							Do no extort thy reasons from this clause,
							For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,
							But rather reason thus with reason fetter,
							Love sought is good, but given unsought better.

**Cesario**:					By innocence I swear, and by my youth
							I have on heart, one bosom and one truth,
							And that no woman has; nor never none
							Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
							And so adieu, good madam: never more
							Will I my master's tears to you deplore.

**Olivia**:					Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
							That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.

[Exeunt]()

## Scene II

[Olivia's garden]()

[Enter Sir Toby, Maria, Fabian]()

**Sir Toby Belcn**:	...
					This will so fright them both that they will kill
					one another by the look, like conckatrices.

[Re-enter Olivia, with Cesario]()

**Fabian**:			Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
					he take leave, and presently after him.

**Sir Toby Belch**:	I will meditate the while upon some horrid message
					for a challenge.

[Exeunt Sir Toby, Fabian, and Maria]()

**Olivia**:			I have said too much unto a heart of stone
					And laid mine honour too unchary out.
					There's something in me that reproves my fault;
					But such a headstrong potent fault it is,
					That it but mocks reproof.
 
**Cesario**:			With the same 'havior that your passion bears
					Goes on my master's griefs.
 
**Olivia**:			Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;
					Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;
					And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
					What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,
					That honour saved may upon asking give?
 
**Cesario**:			Nothing but this; your true love for my master.
 
**Olivia**:			How with mine honour may I give him that
					Which I have given to you?
 
**Cesario**:			I will acquit you.
 
**Olivia**:			Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:
					A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
 
[Exit Olivia]()

[Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN]()
 
**Sir Toby Belch**: Gentleman, God save thee. [watch this section on youtube]
 
**Cesario**:			And you, sir.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	That defence thou hast, betake thee to't. Of what
					nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know
					not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as
					the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:
					dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for
					thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.
 
**Cesario**:			You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel
					to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from
					any image of offence done to any man.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore;
					if you hold your life at any price, betake you to
					your guard; for your opposite hath in him what
					youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.
 
**Cesario**:			I pray you, sir, what is he?
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on
					carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private
					brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and
					his incensement at this moment is so implacable,
					that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
					and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.
 
**Cesario**:			I will return again into the house and desire some
					conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard
					of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
					others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man
					of that quirk.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a
					very competent injury: therefore, get you on and
					give him his desire. Back you shall not to the
					house, unless you undertake that with me which with
					as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,
					or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you
					must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.
 
**Cesario**:			This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me
					this courteous office, as to know of the knight what
					my offence to him is: it is something of my
					negligence, nothing of my purpose.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this
					gentleman till my return.
 
[Exit]()
 
**Cesario**:			Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
 
**Fabian**:			I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a
					mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.
 
**Cesario**:			I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
 
**Fabian**:			Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by
					his form, as you are like to find him in the proof
					of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,
					bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
					have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
					towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can.
 
**Cesario**:			I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that
					had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I
					care not who knows so much of my mettle.
 
[Exeunt]()

[Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREW]()
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a
					firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and
					all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal
					motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he
					pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they
					step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
 
**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can
					scarce hold him yonder.
 
**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so
							cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'd
							have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,
							and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show
					on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.
					[Aside]
					Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
					[Re-enter FABIAN and Cesario]()
					[To FABIAN]()
					I have his horse to take up the quarrel:
					I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.
 
**Fabian**:			He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and
					looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	[To Cesario]() There's no remedy, sir; he will fight
					with you for's oath sake. Marry, he hath better
					bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now
					scarce to be worth talking of. Therefore draw, for
					the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.
 
**Cesario**:			[Aside]() Pray God defend me! A little thing would
					make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
 
**Fabian**:			Give ground, if you see him furious.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman
					will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;
					he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has
					promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he
					will not hurt you. Come on; to't.
 
**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	Pray God, he keep his oath!
 
**Cesario**:			I do assure you, 'tis against my will.
 
[They draw]()
 
[Enter ANTONIO]()
 
**Antonio**:		Put up your sword. If this young gentleman
					Have done offence, I take the fault on me:
					If you offend him, I for him defy you.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	You, sir! Why, what are you?
 
**Antonio**:		One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
					Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.

[They draw]()
 
[Enter Officers]()
 
**Fabian**:			O good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	I'll be with you anon.
 
**Cesario**:			Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.
 
**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you,
							I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily
							and reins well.
 
**First Officer**:	This is the man; do thy office.
 
**Second Officer**:	Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.
 
**Antonio**:		You do mistake me, sir.
 
**First Officer**:	No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,
					Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.
					Take him away: he knows I know him well.
 
**Antonio**:		I must obey.
					[To Cesario]()
					This comes with seeking you:
					But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.
					What will you do, now my necessity
					Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
					Much more for what I cannot do for you
					Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
					But be of comfort.
 
**Second Officer**:	Come, sir, away.
 
**Antonio**:		I must entreat of you some of that money.
 
**Cesario**:			What money, sir?
					For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,
					And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,
					Out of my lean and low ability
					I'll lend you something: my having is not much;
					I'll make division of my present with you:
					Hold, there's half my coffer.
 
**Antonio**:		Will you deny me now?
					Is't possible that my deserts to you
					Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
					Lest that it make me so unsound a man
					As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
					That I have done for you.
 
**Cesario**:			I know of none;
					Nor know I you by voice or any feature:
					I hate ingratitude more in a man
					Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
					Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
					Inhabits our frail blood.
 
**Antonio**:		O heavens themselves!
 
**Second Officer**:	Come, sir, I pray you, go.
 
**Antonio**:		Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
					I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,
					Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
					And to his image, which methought did promise
					Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
 
**First Officer**:	What's that to us? The time goes by: away!
 
**Antonio**:		But O how vile an idol proves this god
					Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
					In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
					None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
					Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
					Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.
 
**First Officer**:	The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.
 
**Antonio**:		Lead me on.
 
[Exit with Officers]()
 
**Cesario**:			Methinks his words do from such passion fly,
					That he believes himself: so do not I.
					Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
					That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'll
					whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
 
**Cesario**:			He named Sebastian: I my brother know
					Yet living in my glass; even such and so
					In favour was my brother, and he went
					Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,
					For him I imitate: O, if it prove,
					Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.

# Act IV

## Scene I

[Before Olivia's house]()

[Enter Duke Orsino, Viola, Curio, and Lords]()

**Orsino**:			Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
 
**Feste**:			Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.
 
**Orsino**:			I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?
 
**Feste**:			Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse
					for my friends.
 
**Orsino**:			Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.
 
**Feste**:			No, sir, the worse.
 
**Orsino**:			How can that be?
 
**Feste**:			Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me;
					now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by
					my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,
					and by my friends, I am abused: so that,
					conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives
					make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for
					my friends and the better for my foes.
 
**Orsino**:			Why, this is excellent.
 
**Feste**:			By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be
					one of my friends.
 
**Orsino**:			Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.
 
**Feste**:			But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would
					you could make it another.
 
**Orsino**:			O, you give me ill counsel.
 
**Feste**:			Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,
					and let your flesh and blood obey it.
 
**Orsino**:			Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a
					double-dealer: there's another.
 
**Feste**:			Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old
					saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,
					sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of
					Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind; one, two, three.
 
**Orsino**:			You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:
					if you will let your lady know I am here to speak
					with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake
					my bounty further.
 
**Feste**:			Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come
					again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think
					that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:
					but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I
					will awake it anon.
 
[Exit Feste]()
 
**Cesario**:			Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.
 
[Enter ANTONIO and Officers]()
 
**Orsino**:			That face of his I do remember well;
					Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd
					As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
					A bawbling vessel was he captain of,
					For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;
					With which such scathful grapple did he make
					With the most noble bottom of our fleet,
					That very envy and the tongue of loss
					Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?
 
**First Officer**:	Orsino, this is that Antonio
					That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;
					And this is he that did the Tiger board,
					When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
					Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
					In private brabble did we apprehend him.
 
**Cesario**:			He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;
					But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
					I know not what 'twas but distraction.
 
**Orsino**:			Notable pirate! Thou salt-water thief!
					What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,
					Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
					Hast made thine enemies?
 
**Antonio**:		Orsino, noble sir,
					Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
					Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
					Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
					Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
					That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
					From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
					Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
					His life I gave him and did thereto add
					My love, without retention or restraint,
					All his in dedication; for his sake
					Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
					Into the danger of this adverse town;
					Drew to defend him when he was beset:
					Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
					Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
					Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
					And grew a twenty years removed thing
					While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
					Which I had recommended to his use
					Not half an hour before.
 
**Cesario**:			How can this be?
 
**Orsino**:			When came he to this town?
 
**Antonio**:		To-day, my lord; and for three months before,
					No interim, not a minute's vacancy,
					Both day and night did we keep company.

[Enter OLIVIA and Attendants]()
 
**Orsino**:			Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.
					But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:
					Three months this youth hath tended upon me;
					But more of that anon. Take him aside.
 
**Olivia**:			What would my lord, but that he may not have,
					Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
					Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
 
**Cesario**:			Madam!
 
**Orsino**:			Gracious Olivia,—
 
**Olivia**:			What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,—
 
**Cesario**:			My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.
 
**Olivia**:			If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
					It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
					As howling after music.
 
**Orsino**:			Still so cruel?
 
**Olivia**:			Still so constant, lord.
 
**Orsino**:			What, to perverseness? You uncivil lady,
					To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
					My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
					That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
 
**Olivia**:			Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.
 
**Orsino**:			Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,
					Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,
					Kill what I love?—a savage jealousy
					That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:
					Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
					And that I partly know the instrument
					That screws me from my true place in your favour,
					Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
					But this your minion, whom I know you love,
					And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
					Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,
					Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
					Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:
					I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
					To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
 
**Cesario**:			And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,
					To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
 
**Olivia**:			Where goes Cesario?
 
**Cesario**:			After him I love
					More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
					More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.
					If I do feign, you witnesses above
					Punish my life for tainting of my love!
 
**Olivia**:			Ay me, detested! How am I beguiled!
 
**Cesario**:			Who does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?
 
**Olivia**:			Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?
					Call forth the holy father.
 
**Orsino**:			Come, away!
 
**Olivia**:			Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.
 
**Orsino**:			Husband!
 
**Olivia**:			Ay, husband. Can he that deny?
 
**Orsino**:			Her husband, sirrah!
 
**Cesario**:			No, my lord, not I.
 
**Olivia**:			Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear
					That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
					Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;
					Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art 2345
					As great as that thou fear'st.
					[Enter Priest]()
					O, welcome, father!
					Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,
					Here to unfold, though lately we intended
					To keep in darkness what occasion now
					Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
					Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.
 
**Priest**:			A contract of eternal bond of love,
					Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,
					Attested by the holy close of lips,
					Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;
					And all the ceremony of this compact
					Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:
					Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave
					I have travell'd but two hours.
 
**Orsino**:			O thou dissembling cub, what wilt thou be
					When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
					Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,
					That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
					Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
					Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
 
**Cesario**:			My lord, I do protest—
 
**Olivia**:			O, do not swear!
					Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
 
[Enter SIR ANDREW]()
 
**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently
							to Sir Toby.
 
**Olivia**:			What's the matter?
 
**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
							a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your
							help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
 
**Olivia**:			Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
 
**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	The count's gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for
							a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.
 
**Orsino**:			My gentleman, Cesario?
 
**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for
							nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do't
							by Sir Toby.
 
**Cesario**:			Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
					You drew your sword upon me without cause;
					But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.
 
**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I
							think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
							[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown]()
							Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:
							but if he had not been in drink, he would have
							tickled you othergates than he did.
 
**Orsino**:			How now, gentleman! How is't with you?
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end on't.
					[To FESTE]() Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?
 
**Feste**:			O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes
					were set at eight i' the morning.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	Then he's a rogue, and a passy-measures pavin. I
					hate a drunken rogue. 2400
 
**Olivia**:			Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?
 
**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	Will you help? An ass-head and a coxcomb and a
					knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!
 
**Olivia**:			Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.
 
[Exeunt Clown, FABIAN, SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW]()
 
[Enter SEBASTIAN]()
 
**Sebastian**:		I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:
					But, had it been the brother of my blood,
					I must have done no less with wit and safety.
					You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
					I do perceive it hath offended you.
					Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
					We made each other but so late ago.
 
**Orsino**:			One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,
					A natural perspective, that is and is not!
 
**Sebastian**:		Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
					How have the hours racked and tortured me,
					Since I have lost thee!
 
**Antonio**:		Sebastian are you?
 
**Sebastian**:		Fear'st thou that, Antonio?
 
**Antonio**:		How have you made division of yourself?
					An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin
					Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
 
**Olivia**:			Most wonderful!
 
**Sebastian**:		Do I stand there? I never had a brother;
					Nor can there be that deity in my nature,
					Of here and every where. I had a sister,
					Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
					Of charity, what kin are you to me?
					What countryman? What name? What parentage?
 
**Viola**:			Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;
					Such a Sebastian was my brother too,
					So went he suited to his watery tomb:
					If spirits can assume both form and suit
					You come to fright us.
 
**Sebastian**:		A spirit I am indeed;
					But am in that dimension grossly clad
					Which from the womb I did participate.
					Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
					I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
					And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'
 
**Viola**:			My father had a mole upon his brow.
 
**Sebastian**:		And so had mine.
 
**Viola**:			And died that day when Viola from her birth
					Had number'd thirteen years.
 
**Sebastian**:		O, that record is lively in my soul!
					He finished indeed his mortal act
					That day that made my sister thirteen years.
 
**Viola**:			If nothing lets to make us happy both
					But this my masculine usurp'd attire,
					Do not embrace me till each circumstance
					Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
					That I am Viola: which to confirm,
					I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
					Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
					I was preserved to serve this noble count.
					All the occurrence of my fortune since
					Hath been between this lady and this lord.
 
**Sebastian**:		[To OLIVIA]() So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:
					But nature to her bias drew in that.
					You would have been contracted to a maid;
					Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
					You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
 
**Orsino**:			Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.
					If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
					I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
					[To VIOLA]()
					Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
					Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
 
**Viola**:			And all those sayings will I overswear;
					And those swearings keep as true in soul
					As doth that orbed continent the fire
					That severs day from night.
 
**Orsino**:			Give me thy hand;
					And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
 
**Viola**:			The captain that did bring me first on shore
					Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
					Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,
					A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.
 
**Olivia**:			He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
					And yet, alas, now I remember me,
					They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
					[Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN]()
					A most extracting frenzy of mine own
					From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
					How does he, sirrah?
 
**Feste**:			Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as
					well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
					letter to you; I should have given't you to-day
					morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,
					so it skills not much when they are delivered.
 
**Olivia**:			Open't, and read it.
 
**Feste**:			Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
					the madman.
					[Reads]()
					'By the Lord, madam,'—
 
**Olivia**:			How now! Art thou mad?
 
**Feste**:			No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship
					will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.
 
**Olivia**:			Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
 
**Feste**:			So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to
					read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
 
**Olivia**:			Read it you, sirrah.
					[To FABIAN]()
					Fabian. [Reads]() 'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the
					world shall know it: though you have put me into
					darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
					me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as
					your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
					me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt
					not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.
					Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
					unthought of and speak out of my injury.
					THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'
 
**Olivia**:			Did he write this?
 
**Feste**:			Ay, madam.
 
**Orsino**:			This savours not much of distraction.
 
**Olivia**:			See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.
					[Exit FABIAN]()
					My lord so please you, these things further thought on,
					To think me as well a sister as a wife,
					One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,
					Here at my house and at my proper cost.
 
**Orsino**:			Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.
					[To VIOLA]()
					Your master quits you; and for your service done him,
					So much against the mettle of your sex,
					So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
					And since you call'd me master for so long,
					Here is my hand: you shall from this time be
					Your master's mistress.
 
**Olivia**:			A sister! You are she.
 
[Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO]()
 
**Orsino**:			Is this the madman?
 
**Olivia**:			Ay, my lord, this same.
					How now, Malvolio!
 
**Malvolio**:		Madam, you have done me wrong,
					Notorious wrong.
 
**Olivia**:			Have I, Malvolio? No.
 
**Malvolio**:		Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.
					You must not now deny it is your hand:
					Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;
					Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:
					You can say none of this: well, grant it then
					And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
					Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,
					Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,
					To put on yellow stockings and to frown
					Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
					And, acting this in an obedient hope,
					Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
					Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
					And made the most notorious geck and gull
					That e'er invention play'd on? Tell me why.
 
**Olivia**:		Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
				Though, I confess, much like the character
				But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
				And now I do bethink me, it was she
				First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,
				And in such forms which here were presupposed
				Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:
				This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;
				But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
				Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
				Of thine own cause.
 
**Fabian**:		Good madam, hear me speak,
				And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
				Taint the condition of this present hour,
				Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,
				Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
				Set this device against Malvolio here,
				Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
				We had conceived against him: Maria writ
				The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;
				In recompense whereof he hath married her.
				How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,
				May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;
				If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
				That have on both sides pass'd.
 
**Olivia**:		Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
 
**Feste**:		Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,
				and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was
				one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but
				that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'
				But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such
				a barren rascal? An you smile not, he's gagged:'
				and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
 
**Malvolio**:	I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
 
[Exit Malvolio]()
 
**Olivia**:		He hath been most notoriously abused.
 
**Orsino**:		Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
				He hath not told us of the captain yet.
				When that is known and golden time convents,
				A solemn combination shall be made
				Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,
				We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;
				For so you shall be, while you are a man;
				But when in other habits you are seen,
				Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.
 
[Exeunt all, except Clown]()

**Feste**:	[Sings]()
			When that I was and a little tiny boy,
			With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
			A foolish thing was but a toy,
			For the rain it raineth every day.

**Feste**:	[Singing]()
			But when I came to man's estate,
			With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
			'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,
			For the rain it raineth every day.

**Feste**:	[Singing]()
			But when I came, alas! to wive,
			With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
			By swaggering could I never thrive,
			For the rain it raineth every day.

**Feste**:	[Singing]()
			But when I came unto my beds,
			With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
			With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
			For the rain it raineth every day.

**Feste**:	[Singing]()
			A great while ago the world begun,
			With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
			But that's all one, our play is done,
			And we'll strive to please you every day.
