# Act II

## Scene I

[A street]()

[Enter Cesario, Malvolio following]()

**Malvolio**:	Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?

**Cesario**:		Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since
				arrive but hither.

**Malvolio**:	She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have
				saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.
				She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord
				into a desperate assurnace she will none of him:
				and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to
				come again in his affairs, unless it be to report
				your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.

**Cesario**:		She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.

**Malvolio**:	Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her
				will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth
				stooping for, there is lies in your eye; if not, be
				it his that finds it.

[Malvolio throws ring on ground]()

[Exit Malvolio]()

**Cesario**:		I left no ring with her: what means this lady?
				Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
				She made good view of me, indeed, so much,
				That sure methought her eyes has lost her tounge,
				For she did speak in starts distractedly.
				She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion
				Invites me in this churlish messenger.
				None of my lord's ring! Why, he sent her none.
				I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis
				Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
				Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,
				Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
				How easy is it for the proper-false
				In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
				Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
				For such as we are made of, such we be.
				How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly;
				And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
				And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
				What will become of this? As i am man,
				My state is desperate for my master's love;
				As I am woman, -- now alas the day! --
				What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
				Oh time! though must untangle this, not I:
				It is too hard a know for me to untie!

[Exit Cesario]()

## Scene II

[Duke Orsino's palace]()

[Enter Duke Orsino, Cesario, Curio, and others]()

**Orsino**:	Give moe some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
			Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
			That old and antique song we heard last night:
			Methought it did relieve my passion much,
			More than light airs and recollected terms
			Of these most brisk and gidd-paced times:
			Come, but one verse.

**Curio**:	He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.

**Orsino**:	Who was it?

**Curio**:	Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady
			Olivia's fater took much delight in. He is about the house.

**Orsino**:	Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
			[Exit Curio, Music plays]()
			Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,
			In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
			For such as I am all true lovers are,
			Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,
			Save in the constant image of the createure
			That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?

**Cesario**:	It give a very echo to the seat
			Where Love is throned.

**Orsino**:	Thou dost speak masterly:
			My life upon't, you though thou aret, thine eye
			Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:
			Hath it not, boy?

**Cesario**:	A little, by your favour.

**Orsino**:	What kind of woman is't?

**Cesario**:	Of your complexion.

**Orsino**:	She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?

**Cesario**:	About your years, my lord.

**Orsino**:	Too old by heaven: let still the woman take
			An elder than herself: so wears she to him,
			So sways she level in her husband's hears.
			For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
			Our fancies are more guddy and unfirm,
			More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
			Than women's are.

**Cesario**:	I think it well, my lord.

**Orsino**:	Then let love be younger than thyself,
			Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
			For women are as roses, whose fair flower
			Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.

**Cesario**:	And so they are: alas, that are so;
			To die, even when they to perfection grow!

[Re-ender Curio and Clown]()

**Orsino**:	O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.
			Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;
			The spinsters and the knotters in the sun
			And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
			Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
			And dallies with the innocence of love,
			Like the old age.

**Feste**:	Are you ready, sir?

**Orsino**:	Ay; prithee, sing.
			[Music]()

**Feste**:	Come away, come away, death,
			And in sad cypress let me be laid;
			Fly away, fly away breath;
			I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
			My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
			O, prepare it!
			My part of death, no one so true
			Did share it.
			Not a flower, not a flower sweet
			On my black coffin let there be strown;
			Not a friend, not a friend greet
			My poort corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:
			A thousand thousand sighs to save,
			Lay me, O, where
			Sad true lover never find my grave,
			To weep there!

**Orsino**:	There's for thy pains.

**Feste**:	No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.

**Orsino**:	I'll pay thy pleasure then.

**Feste**:	Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.

**Orsino**:	Give me now leave to leave thee.

**Feste**:	Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the
			tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta,
			thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
			constancy put to sea, that their business might be
			every thing and their intent every where; for that's
			it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.

[Exit Feste]()

**Orsino**:	Let all the rest give place.
			[Curio and Attendants retire]()
			Once more, Cesario,
			Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
			Tell her, my love, more moble than the world,
			Prizes not quantity of ditry lands;
			The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,
			Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
			But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
			That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.

**Cesario**:	But if she cannot love you, sir?

**Orsino**:	I cannot be so answer'd.

**Cesario**:	Sooth, but you must.
			Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
			Hath for you love a great a pang of heart
			As you have for Olivia: you cannot lover her;
			You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?

**Orsino**:	There is no woman's sides
			Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
			As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
			So big, to hold so much; they lack retention
			Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,
			No motion of the liver, but the palate,
			That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;
			But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
			And can digest as much: make no compare
			Between that love a woman can bear me
			And that I owe Olivia.

**Cesario**:	Ay, but I know --

**Orsino**:	What does thou know?

**Cesario**:	Too well that love women to men may owe:
			In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
			My fater had a daughter loved a man,
			As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
			I should your lordship.

**Orsino**:	And what's her history?

**Cesario**:	A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
			But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
			Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in though,
			And with a green and yellow melancholy
			She sat like patience on a monument,
			Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
			We men may say more, swear more: but indeed
			Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
			Much in our vows, but little in our love.

**Orsino**:	But died thy sister of her love, my boy?

**Cesario**:	I am all the daughters of my father's house,
			And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.
			Sir, shall I to this lady?

**Orsino**:	Ay, that's the theme.
			To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,
			My love can give no place, bide no denay.
