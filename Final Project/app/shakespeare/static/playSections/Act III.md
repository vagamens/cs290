# Act III

## Scene I

[Olivia's garden]()

[Enter Viola, and Clown with a tabour]()

**Viola**:	Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by
			thy tabour?

**Feste**:	No, sir, I live by the church.

**Viola**:	Art thou a churchman?

**Feste**:	No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for
			I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by
			the church.

**Viola**:	So thou mayst say, the king lies by a begger, if a
			beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy
			tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.

**Feste**:	You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is
			but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
			wrong side my be turned outward.

**Viola**:	Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with
			words may quickly make them wanton.

**Feste**:	I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.

**Viola**:	Why, man?

**Feste**:	WHy, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that
			word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words
			are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.

**Viola**:	Thy reason, man?

**Feste**:	Troth, sir, I can yield you non without words; and
			words are grown so false, I am loath to prove
			reason with them.

**Viola**:	I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.

**Feste**:	No so, sir I do care for something; but in my
			conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be
			to care for nothing, sir, I would make you invisible.

**Viola**:	Art thou the Lady Olivia's fool?

**Feste**:	No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she
			will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and
			fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
			herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not
			her fool, but her corrupter of words.

**Viola**:	I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.

**Feste**:	Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,
			it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but
			the fool should be as oft with your master as with
			my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.

**Viola**:	Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.
			Hold, there's expenses for thee.

**Feste**:	Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!

**Viola**:	BY my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sock for
			one;
			[Aside]()
			though I would not have it grown on my chin.
			[To Feste]()
			Is thy lady within?

**Feste**:	Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?

**Viola**:	Yes, being kept together and put to use.

**Feste**:	I would play Lord Pandarus of Phyrygia, sir, to bring
			a Cressida to this Troilus

**Viola**:	I understand you, sir; 'tis will begged.

**Feste**:	The matter, I hope, is not greate, sir, begging but
			a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is
			within, sir. I will construe to them whence you
			come; who you are and what you would are out of my
			welkin, I might say 'element', but the word is over-worn.

[Exit Feste]()

**Viola**:	This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
			And to do that well craves a kind of with:
			He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
			The quality of persons, and the time,
			And, like the hagard, cheque at every feather
			That comes before his eye. THis is a practise
			As full of labour as a wise man's art
			For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
			But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.

[Enter Sir Toby Belch, and Sir Andrew]()

**Sir Toby Belch**:			Save you, gentleman,

**Viola**:					And you, sir.

**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	Dieu vous garde, monsieur.

**Viola**:					Et vous assi; votre serviteur.

**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.

**Sir Toby Belch**:			Will you encounter the house? My neive is desirous
							you should enter, if you trade be to her.

**Viola**:					I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the
							list of my voyage.

**Sir Toby Belch**:			I mean, to go, sir, to enter.

**Viola**:					I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we
							are prevented.
							[Enter Olivia and Maria]()
							Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain
							odours on you!

**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	That youth's a rare cortuer: 'Rain odours;' well.

**Viola**:					My matter hath no voice, to your own mast prgnant
							and vouchsafed ear.

**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em
							all three al ready.

**Olivia**:					Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.
							[Exeunt Toby, Andrew and Maria]
							Give me your hand, sir.

**Viola**:					My duty, madam, and most humble service.

**Olivia**:					What is your name?

**Viola**:					Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.

**Olivia**:					My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world
							Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:
							You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.

**Viola**:					And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:
							Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.

**Olivia**:					For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,
							Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!

**Viola**:					Madam, I come to whet you gentle thoughts
							On his behalf.

**Olivia**:					O, by your leave, I pray you,
							I bade you never speak again of him;
							But, would you undertake another suit,
							I had rather hear you to solicit that
							Than music from the spheres.

**Viola**:					Dear lady, --

**Olivia**:					Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,
							After the last enchantment you did here,
							A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
							Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:
							Under your hard construction must I sit,
							To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
							Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
							Have you not set mine honour at the stake
							And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
							That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
							Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,
							Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.

**Viola**:					I pity you.

**Olivia**:					That's a degree to love.

**Viola**:					No, not a grize: for 'tis a vulgar proof,
							That very oft we pity enemies.

**Olivia**:					Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.
							O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
							If one should be a prey, how much the better
							To fail before the lion than the wolf?
							[Clock strikes]
							The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
							Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:
							And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
							You were is alike to reap a proper man:
							There lies your way, due west.

**Viola**:					Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition
							Attend your ladyship!
							You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?

**Olivia**:					Stay.
							I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.

**Viola**:					That you do think you are not what you are.

**Olivia**:					If I think so, I think the same of you.

**Viola**:					Then think you right: I am not what I am.

**Olivia**:					I would you were as I would have you be!

**Viola**:					Would it be better, madam, than I am?
							I wish it might, for now I am your fool.

**Olivia**:					O, what a deal of scorn look beautuful
							In the contempt and anger of his lip!
							A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
							Than love that would seem hid: live's night is noon.
							Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
							By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,
							I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
							Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
							Do no extort thy reasons from this clause,
							For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,
							But rather reason thus with reason fetter,
							Love sought is good, but given unsought better.

**Viola**:					By innocence I swear, and by my youth
							I have on heart, one bosom and one truth,
							And that no woman has; nor never none
							Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
							And so adieu, good madam: never more
							Will I my master's tears to you deplore.

**Olivia**:					Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
							That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.

[Exeunt]()

## Scene IV

[Olivia's garden]()

[Enter Sir Toby, Maria, Fabian]()

**Sir Toby Belcn**:	...
					This will so fright them both that they will kill
					one another by the look, like conckatrices.

[Re-enter Olivia, with Viola]()

**Fabian**:			Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
					he take leave, and presently after him.

**Sir Toby Belch**:	I will meditate the while upon some horrid message
					for a challenge.

[Exeunt Sir Toby, Fabian, and Maria]()

**Olivia**:			I have said too much unto a heart of stone
					And laid mine honour too unchary out.
					There's something in me that reproves my fault;
					But such a headstrong potent fault it is,
					That it but mocks reproof.
 
**Viola**:			With the same 'havior that your passion bears
					Goes on my master's griefs.
 
**Olivia**:			Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;
					Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;
					And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
					What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,
					That honour saved may upon asking give?
 
**Viola**:			Nothing but this; your true love for my master.
 
**Olivia**:			How with mine honour may I give him that
					Which I have given to you?
 
**Viola**:			I will acquit you.
 
**Olivia**:			Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:
					A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
 
[Exit Olivia]()

[Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN]()
 
**Sir Toby Belch**: Gentleman, God save thee. [watch this section on youtube]
 
**Viola**:			And you, sir.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	That defence thou hast, betake thee to't. Of what
					nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know
					not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as
					the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:
					dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for
					thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.
 
**Viola**:			You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel
					to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from
					any image of offence done to any man.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore;
					if you hold your life at any price, betake you to
					your guard; for your opposite hath in him what
					youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.
 
**Viola**:			I pray you, sir, what is he?
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on
					carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private
					brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and
					his incensement at this moment is so implacable,
					that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
					and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.
 
**Viola**:			I will return again into the house and desire some
					conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard
					of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
					others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man
					of that quirk.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a
					very competent injury: therefore, get you on and
					give him his desire. Back you shall not to the
					house, unless you undertake that with me which with
					as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,
					or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you
					must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.
 
**Viola**:			This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me
					this courteous office, as to know of the knight what
					my offence to him is: it is something of my
					negligence, nothing of my purpose.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this
					gentleman till my return.
 
[Exit]()
 
**Viola**:			Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
 
**Fabian**:			I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a
					mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.
 
**Viola**:			I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
 
**Fabian**:			Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by
					his form, as you are like to find him in the proof
					of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,
					bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
					have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
					towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can.
 
**Viola**:			I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that
					had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I
					care not who knows so much of my mettle.
 
[Exeunt]()

[Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREW]()
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a
					firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and
					all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal
					motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he
					pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they
					step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
 
**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can
					scarce hold him yonder.
 
**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so
							cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'd
							have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,
							and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show
					on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.
					[Aside]
					Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
					[Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA]()
					[To FABIAN]()
					I have his horse to take up the quarrel:
					I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.
 
**Fabian**:			He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and
					looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	[To VIOLA]() There's no remedy, sir; he will fight
					with you for's oath sake. Marry, he hath better
					bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now
					scarce to be worth talking of. Therefore draw, for
					the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.
 
**Viola**:			[Aside]() Pray God defend me! A little thing would
					make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
 
**Fabian**:			Give ground, if you see him furious.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman
					will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;
					he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has
					promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he
					will not hurt you. Come on; to't.
 
**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	Pray God, he keep his oath!
 
**Viola**:			I do assure you, 'tis against my will.
 
[They draw]()
 
[Enter ANTONIO]()
 
**Antonio**:		Put up your sword. If this young gentleman
					Have done offence, I take the fault on me:
					If you offend him, I for him defy you.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	You, sir! Why, what are you?
 
**Antonio**:		One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
					Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.

[They draw]()
 
[Enter Officers]()
 
**Fabian**:			O good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers.
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	I'll be with you anon.
 
**Viola**:			Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.
 
**Sir Andrew Aguecheek**:	Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you,
							I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily
							and reins well.
 
**First Officer**:	This is the man; do thy office.
 
**Second Officer**:	Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.
 
**Antonio**:		You do mistake me, sir.
 
**First Officer**:	No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,
					Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.
					Take him away: he knows I know him well.
 
**Antonio**:		I must obey.
					[To VIOLA]()
					This comes with seeking you:
					But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.
					What will you do, now my necessity
					Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
					Much more for what I cannot do for you
					Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
					But be of comfort.
 
**Second Officer**:	Come, sir, away.
 
**Antonio**:		I must entreat of you some of that money.
 
**Viola**:			What money, sir?
					For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,
					And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,
					Out of my lean and low ability
					I'll lend you something: my having is not much;
					I'll make division of my present with you:
					Hold, there's half my coffer.
 
**Antonio**:		Will you deny me now?
					Is't possible that my deserts to you
					Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
					Lest that it make me so unsound a man
					As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
					That I have done for you.
 
**Viola**:			I know of none;
					Nor know I you by voice or any feature:
					I hate ingratitude more in a man
					Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
					Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
					Inhabits our frail blood.
 
**Antonio**:		O heavens themselves!
 
**Second Officer**:	Come, sir, I pray you, go.
 
**Antonio**:		Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
					I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,
					Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
					And to his image, which methought did promise
					Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
 
**First Officer**:	What's that to us? The time goes by: away!
 
**Antonio**:		But O how vile an idol proves this god
					Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
					In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
					None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
					Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
					Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.
 
**First Officer**:	The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.
 
**Antonio**:		Lead me on.
 
[Exit with Officers]()
 
**Viola**:			Methinks his words do from such passion fly,
					That he believes himself: so do not I.
					Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
					That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
 
**Sir Toby Belch**:	Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'll
					whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
 
**Viola**:			He named Sebastian: I my brother know
					Yet living in my glass; even such and so
					In favour was my brother, and he went
					Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,
					For him I imitate: O, if it prove,
					Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.
 
[Exeunt]()
