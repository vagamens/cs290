# Act I

## Scene II

[At sea on a boat]

[Enter Viola, a Captain, and Sailors]

**Viola**:   What country, friends, is this?

**Captain**: This is Illyria, lady.

**Viola**:   And what should I do in Illyria?
			 My brother he is in Elysium.
			 Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?

**Captain**: It is perchance that you yourself were saved.

**Viola**:   O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.

**Captain**: True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
			 Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
			 When you and those poor number saved with you
			 Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
			 Most provident in peril, bind himself,
			 Courage and hope both teaching him the practice,
			 To a string mast that lived upon the sea;
			 Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
			 I saw him hold acquaintance with the waved
			 So long as I could see.

**Viola**:	 For saying so, there's gold:
			 Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
			 Where to thy speech serves for authority,
			 The like of him. Know'st thou this country?

**Captain**: Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
			 Not three hours' travel from this very place.

**Viola**:	 Who governs here?

**Captain**: A noble duke, in nature as in name.

**Viola**:	 What is the name?

**Captain**: Orsino.

**Viola**:	 Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
			 He was a bachelor then.

**Captain**: And so is  now, or was so very late;
			 For but a month ago I went from hence,
			 And then 'twas freshin murmur, -- as, you know,
			 What great ones do the less will prattle of, --
			 That he did seek the love of fiar Olivia.

**Viola**:	 What's she?

**Captain**: A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
			 That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
			 In the protection of his son, her brother,
			 Who shortly also dies: for whose dear love,
			 They say, she hath abjured the company
			 And sight of men.

**Viola**:	 O that I served that lady
			 And might not be delivered to the world,
			 Till I made mine own occasion mellow,
			 What my estate is!

**Captain**: That were hard to compass;
			 Because she will admit no kind of suit,
			 No, not the duke's.

**Viola**:	 There is a fiar behavior in thee, captain;
			 And though that nature with a beauteous wall
			 Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
			 I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
			 With this thy fair and outward character,
			 I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
			 Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
			 For such disguise as haply shall become
			 The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
			 Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
			 It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
			 And speak to him in many sorts of music
			 That will allow him in many sorts of music
			 That will allow me very worth his service.
			 What else may hap to time I will commit;
			 Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.

**Captain**: Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
			 When my tounge blabs, then let mine eyes not see.

**Viola**:	 I thank thee: lead me on.

## Secne IV

[Duke Orsino's palace]

[Enter Valentine and Viola in man's attire]

**Valentine**:	If theduke continue theses favours towards you,
				Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath
				known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.

**Viola**:		You either fear his humour or my negligence, that
				you call in question the continuance of his love:
				is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?

**Valentine**:	No, believe me.

**Viola**:		I thank you. Here comes the count

[Enter Duke Orsino, Curio, and Attendants]

**Orsino**:		Who saw Cesario, ho?

**Viola**:		On you attendance, my lord; here.

**Orsino**:		Stand you awhile aloof, Cesario,
				Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
				To thee the book even of my secrel soul:
				Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
				Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
				And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
				Till thou have audience.

**Viola**:		Sure, my noble lord,
				If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
				As it is spoke, she never will admit me.

**Orsino**:		Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
				Rather thn make unprofited return.

**Viola**:		Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?

**Orsino**:		O, then unfold the passion of my love,
				Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
				It shall become thee will to act my woes;
				She will attend it better in thy youth
				Than in a nunvio's of more grave aspect.

**Viola**:		I think not so, my lord.

**Orsino**:		Dear lad, believe it;
				For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
				That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
				Is not more smooth and rubious; they small pipe
				Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
				And all is semblative a woman's part.
				I know thy constellation is right apt
				For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
				All, if you will; for I myself am best
				When least in company. Prosper will in this,
				And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
				To call his fortunes thine.

**Viola**:		I'll do my best
				To woo your lady:
				[Aside]
				Yet, a barful strife!
				Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.

## Scene V

### Rewrite from Viola's perspective

[Olivia's house]

[Enter Maria and Clown(Feste)]

**Maria**:	Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will
			not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
			way of thy excuse: my lady will hange thee for they absence.

**Feste**:	Let her hange me: he that is well hanged in this
			world need to fear no colours.

**Maria**:	Make that good.

**Feste**:	He shell see none to fear.

**Maria**:	A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that
			saying was bor, of 'I fear no colours'

**Feste**:	Where, good Misstress Mary?

**Maria**:	In the wars; an that may you be bold to say in your foolery.

**Feste**:	Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those
			that are fools, let them use their talents.

**Maria**:	Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,
			to be turned away, is not that as good as hanging to you?

**Feste**:	Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,
			for turning away, let summer bear it out.

**Maria**:	You are resolute, then?

**Feste**:	Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.

**Maria**:	That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both
			break, your gaskins fall.

**Feste**:	Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, to thy way; if
			Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a
			piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.

**Maria**;	Peace, you rouge, no more o' that. Here come my
			layd; make your excuse wisely, wer were best.[Exit]

**Feste**:	Wit, an't by thy will, put me into good fooling!
			Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft
			prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may
			pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
			'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'
			[Enter Olivia with Malvolio]
			God bless thee, lady!

**Olivia**:	Take the fool away.

**Feste**:	Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.

**Olivia**:	Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:
			besides, you grow dishonest

**Feste**:	Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel
			will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is
			the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend
			himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if
			he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything
			that's mended is but patched: virtue that
			transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that
			amends is but patched with virute. If that this
			simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will no,
			what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
			calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take
			away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.

**Olivia**:	Sir, I bade them take you away.

**Feste**:	Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non
			facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not
			motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to 
			prove you a fool.

**Olivia**:	Can you do it?

**Feste**:	Dexterously, good madonna.

**Olivia**:	Make your proof.

**Feste**:	I must cateschise you for it, madonna: good my mouse
			of virtue, anser me.

**Olivia**:	Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.

**Feste**:	Good madonna, why mournest thou?

**Olivia**:	Good fool, for my brother's death.

**Feste**:	I think his soul is in hell, madonna.

**Olivia**:	I know his soul is in heaven, fool.

**Feste**:	The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's
			soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.

**Olivia**:	What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he no mend?

**Malvolio**:	Yes, and do till the pangs of death shake him:
				infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the
				better fool.

**Feste**:		God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the
				better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
				sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his
				word for two pence that you are no fool.

**Olivia**:		How say you to that, Malvolio?

**Malvolio**:	I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
				barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
				with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
				than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard
				already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to
				him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,
				that crow so that these set kind of fools, no better
				than the fools' zanies.

**Olivia**:		Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste
				with a distempered appetite. To be generous,
				guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those
				things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:
				there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do
				nother but rail; nor no railing in a known descreet
				man, though he do nother be reprove.

**Feste**:		Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou
				speakest well of fools!

[Re-enter Maria]

**Maria**:		Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much
				desires to speak with you.

**Olivia**:		From the Count Orsino, is it?

**Maria**:		I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.

**Olivia**:		Who of my people hold him in delay?

**Maria**:		Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.

**Olivia**:		Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but
				madman: fie on him!
				[Exit Maria]
				Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I
				am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.
				[Exit Malvolio]
				Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and
				people dislike it.

**Feste**:		Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest
				son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with
				brains! for, -- here he comes, -- one of thy kin has a
				most weak pia mater.

[Enter Sir Toby Belch]

**Olivia**:		By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?

**Sir Toby Belch**:	A gentleman.

**Olivia**:			A gentleman! What gentleman?

**Sir Toby Belch**:	'Tis a gentle man here -- a plague o' these
					pickle-herring! How now, sot!

**Feste**: 			Good Sir Toby!

**Olivia**:			Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?

**Sir Toby Belch**:	Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.

**Olivia**:			Ay, marry, what is he?

**Sir Toby Belch**:	Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give
					me faith, say I. Will, it's all one.

[Exit]

**Olivia**:			What's a drunken man like, fool?

**Feste**:			Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: one
					draft above heat makes him a fool; the second mads
					him; and a third drowns him.

**Olivia**:			Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my
					coz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he's
					drowned: go, look after him.

**Feste**:			His is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look
					to the madman.

[Exit]

[Re-enter Malvolio]

**Malvolio**:		Madam, yound you fellow swears he will speak with
					you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to
					understand so much, and therefore comes to speak
					with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to
					have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore
					comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,
					lady? He's fortified against any denial.

**Olivia**:			Tell him he shall not speak with me.

**Malvolio**:		Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your
					door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to
					a bench, but he'll speak with you.

**Olivia**:			What kind o' man is he?

**Malvolio**:		Why, of mankind.

**Olivia**:			What manner of man?

**Malvolio**:		Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.

**Olivia**:			Of what personage and years is he?

**Malvolio**:		Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for
					a boy; as a squash is before 'tis peascod, or a
					codling when 'tis almost an apple; 'tis with him
					in standing water, between boy and man. He is very
					well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one
					would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.

**Olivia**:			Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.

**Malvolio**:		Gentlewoman, my lady calls.

[Exit]

[Re-enter Maria]

**Olivia**:			Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.
					We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.

### end rewritten section

[Enter Viola and Attendants]

**Viola**:	The honorable lady of the house, which is she?

**Olivia**:	Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
			Your will?

**Viola**:	Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty, -- I
			pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
			for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
			my speech, for beside that it is excellently well
			penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
			beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
			comptible, even to the least sinister usage.

**Olivia**:	Whence came you, sir?

**Viola**:	I can say little more than I have studied, and that
			question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
			modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,
			that I may proceed in my speech.

**Olivia**:	Are you a comedian?

**Viola**:	No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs
			of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you
			the lady of the house?

**Olivia**:	If I do not ursurp myself, I am.

**Viola**:	Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
			youself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours
			to reserver. But this is from my commission: I will
			on with my speech in your praise, and then show you
			the heart of my message.

**Olivia**:	Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.

**Viola**:	Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.

**Olivia**:	It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,
			keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,
			and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
			than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if
			you have reason, be breif: 'tis not that time of
			moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.

**Maria**:	Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.

**Viola**:	No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little
			longer. Some mollification for you giant, sweet
			lady. Tell me your min: I am a messenger.

**Olivia**:	Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when
			the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.

**Viola**:	It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
			war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my
			hand, my words are as fun of peace as matter.

**Olivia**:	Yet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?

**Viola**:	The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
			learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
			would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,
			divinity, to any other's profanation.

**Olivia**:	Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.
			[Exeunt Maria and Attentants]
			Now, sir, what is your text?

**Viola**:	Most sweet lady, --

**Olivia**:	A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
			Where lies your heart?

**Viola**:	In Orsino's bosom.

**Olivai**:	In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?

**Viola**:	To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.

**Olivia**:	O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?

**Viola**:	Good madam, let me see your face.

**Olivia**:	Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
			with my face? You are now out of your text: but
			we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
			Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't
			not well done?

[Unveiling]

**Viola**:	Excellently done, if God did all.

**Olivia**:	'Tis in grain, sir, 'twill endure wind and weather.

**Viola**:	'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
			Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
			Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
			If you will lead these graces to the grave
			And leave the work do copy.

**Olivia**:	O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give
			out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
			inventoried, and every particle and utensil
			labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
			indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to
			them; item, one nech, one chin, and so forth. Were
			you sent hither to praise me?

**Viola**:	I see you what you are, you are too proud;
			But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
			My lod and master loves you: O, such love
			Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd
			The nonpareil of beauty!

**Olivia**:	How does he love me?

**Viola**:	With adorations, fertile tears,
			With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.

**Olivia**:	Your lord dies know my mind; I cannot love him:
			Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
			Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
			In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;
			ANd in dimension and the shape of nature
			A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
			He might have took his answer long ago.

**Viola**:	If I did love you in my master's flame,
			With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
			In you denial I would find no sense;
			I would not understand it.

**Olivia**:	Why, what would you?

**Viola**:	Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
			And call upon my soul within the house;
			Write loyal cantons of contemned love
			And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
			Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
			And make the babbling gossip of the air
			Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest
			Between the elements of air and earth,
			But you should pity me!

**Olivia**:	You might do much.
			What is your parentage?

**Viola**:	Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
			I am a gentleman.

**Olivia**:	Get you to your lord;
			I cannot love him: let him send no more;
			Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
			To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
			I thank you for your pains: spend this for me

[Olivia hands Cesario a coin]

**Viola**:	I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
			My master, not myself, lack recompense.
			Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
			And let your fervor, like my master's, be
			Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.

[Exit]
