# Act I

## Scene I

[At sea on a boat]

[Enter Viola, a Captain, and Sailors]

**Viola**:   What country, friends, is this?

**Captain**: This is Illyria, lady.

**Viola**:   And what should I do in Illyria?
			 My brother he is in Elysium.
			 Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?

**Captain**: It is perchance that you yourself were saved.

**Viola**:   O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.

**Captain**: True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
			 Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
			 When you and those poor number saved with you
			 Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
			 Most provident in peril, bind himself,
			 Courage and hope both teaching him the practice,
			 To a string mast that lived upon the sea;
			 Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
			 I saw him hold acquaintance with the waved
			 So long as I could see.

**Viola**:	 For saying so, there's gold:
			 Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
			 Where to thy speech serves for authority,
			 The like of him. Know'st thou this country?

**Captain**: Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
			 Not three hours' travel from this very place.

**Viola**:	 Who governs here?

**Captain**: A noble duke, in nature as in name.

**Viola**:	 What is the name?

**Captain**: Orsino.

**Viola**:	 Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
			 He was a bachelor then.

**Captain**: And so is  now, or was so very late;
			 For but a month ago I went from hence,
			 And then 'twas freshin murmur, -- as, you know,
			 What great ones do the less will prattle of, --
			 That he did seek the love of fiar Olivia.

**Viola**:	 What's she?

**Captain**: A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
			 That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
			 In the protection of his son, her brother,
			 Who shortly also dies: for whose dear love,
			 They say, she hath abjured the company
			 And sight of men.

**Viola**:	 O that I served that lady
			 And might not be delivered to the world,
			 Till I made mine own occasion mellow,
			 What my estate is!

**Captain**: That were hard to compass;
			 Because she will admit no kind of suit,
			 No, not the duke's.

**Viola**:	 There is a fiar behavior in thee, captain;
			 And though that nature with a beauteous wall
			 Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
			 I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
			 With this thy fair and outward character,
			 I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
			 Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
			 For such disguise as haply shall become
			 The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
			 Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
			 It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
			 And speak to him in many sorts of music
			 That will allow him in many sorts of music
			 That will allow me very worth his service.
			 What else may hap to time I will commit;
			 Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.

**Captain**: Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
			 When my tounge blabs, then let mine eyes not see.

**Viola**:	 I thank thee: lead me on.

## Secne II

[Duke Orsino's palace]

[Enter Valentine and Cesario in man's attire]

**Valentine**:	If theduke continue theses favours towards you,
				Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath
				known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.

**Cesario**:		You either fear his humour or my negligence, that
				you call in question the continuance of his love:
				is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?

**Valentine**:	No, believe me.

**Cesario**:		I thank you. Here comes the count

[Enter Duke Orsino, Curio, and Attendants]

**Orsino**:		Who saw Cesario, ho?

**Cesario**:		On you attendance, my lord; here.

**Orsino**:		Stand you awhile aloof, Cesario,
				Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
				To thee the book even of my secrel soul:
				Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
				Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
				And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
				Till thou have audience.

**Cesario**:		Sure, my noble lord,
				If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
				As it is spoke, she never will admit me.

**Orsino**:		Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
				Rather thn make unprofited return.

**Cesario**:		Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?

**Orsino**:		O, then unfold the passion of my love,
				Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
				It shall become thee will to act my woes;
				She will attend it better in thy youth
				Than in a nunvio's of more grave aspect.

**Cesario**:		I think not so, my lord.

**Orsino**:		Dear lad, believe it;
				For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
				That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
				Is not more smooth and rubious; they small pipe
				Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
				And all is semblative a woman's part.
				I know thy constellation is right apt
				For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
				All, if you will; for I myself am best
				When least in company. Prosper will in this,
				And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
				To call his fortunes thine.

**Cesario**:		I'll do my best
				To woo your lady:
				[Aside]
				Yet, a barful strife!
				Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.

## Scene III

[Courtyard at Olivia's]()

[Enter Cesario, Maria, Sir Toby and Soldiers]()

**Sir Toby**:	Halt! Who would enter my Lady's courtyard?

**Cesario**:	A man who comes in envoy to speak with your Lady.

**Sir Toby**:	[To Maria] Go and tell your Lady of this man's arrival.
				[To Cesario] From whence have you come, sir?

**Cesario**:	From a land filled with many fine things

**Sir Toby**:	Why be it that you com so well attained?

[Enter Maria and Malvolio]()

**Cesario**:	To show my proprietor's ability to those he trusts.

[Exit Sir Toby]()

**Malvolio**:	Good sir, I would welcome you my Lady's court,
				But she would know from whense you came.

**Cesario**:	I come from the land Illyria.

**Malvolio**:	Do you bring suit from the count?

**Cesario**:	I bring his goodwill and a message well crafted.

**Malvolio**:	My Lady will not hear the suit from Orsino.

**Cesario**:	I needs must deliver my message which has been so well crafted.

**Malvolio**:	My Lady has heard many these suits and will not hear another.

[Re-enter Sir Toby]()

**Cesario**:	I bring not a suit, but a plea. That is, to speak with your Lady.

**Malvolio**:	You will not go then?

**Cesario**:	No, sir. I will not go.

[Exit Malvolio and Maria]()

**Sir Toby**:	Will you stay 'till morn? Or will you depart by night?

**Cesario**:	If your Lady hears me well, I shall be on the way by morn.

**Sir Toby**:	Then there shal be sac tonight, if you be there.

[Enter Malvolio]()

**Malvolio**:	My Lady would see you, sir.

**Cesario**:	I thank thee: lead me on, sir.

[Exit All]

## Scene IV

[Olivia's house]

[Enter Olivia, Cesario and Attendants]

**Cesario**:	The honorable lady of the house, which is she?

**Olivia**:	Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
			Your will?

**Cesario**:	Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty, -- I
			pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
			for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
			my speech, for beside that it is excellently well
			penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
			beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
			comptible, even to the least sinister usage.

**Olivia**:	Whence came you, sir?

**Cesario**:	I can say little more than I have studied, and that
			question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
			modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,
			that I may proceed in my speech.

**Olivia**:	Are you a comedian?

**Cesario**:	No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs
			of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you
			the lady of the house?

**Olivia**:	If I do not ursurp myself, I am.

**Cesario**:	Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
			youself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours
			to reserver. But this is from my commission: I will
			on with my speech in your praise, and then show you
			the heart of my message.

**Olivia**:	Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.

**Cesario**:	Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.

**Olivia**:	It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,
			keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,
			and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
			than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if
			you have reason, be breif: 'tis not that time of
			moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.

**Maria**:	Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way.

**Cesario**:	No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little
			longer. Some mollification for you giant, sweet
			lady. Tell me your min: I am a messenger.

**Olivia**:	Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when
			the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.

**Cesario**:	It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
			war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my
			hand, my words are as fun of peace as matter.

**Olivia**:	Yet you began rudely. What are you? What would you?

**Cesario**:	The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
			learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
			would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,
			divinity, to any other's profanation.

**Olivia**:	Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.
			[Exeunt Maria and Attentants]
			Now, sir, what is your text?

**Cesario**:	Most sweet lady, --

**Olivia**:	A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
			Where lies your heart?

**Cesario**:	In Orsino's bosom.

**Olivai**:	In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?

**Cesario**:	To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.

**Olivia**:	O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?

**Cesario**:	Good madam, let me see your face.

**Olivia**:	Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
			with my face? You are now out of your text: but
			we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
			Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't
			not well done?

[Unveiling]

**Cesario**:	Excellently done, if God did all.

**Olivia**:	'Tis in grain, sir, 'twill endure wind and weather.

**Cesario**:	'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
			Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
			Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
			If you will lead these graces to the grave
			And leave the work do copy.

**Olivia**:	O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give
			out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
			inventoried, and every particle and utensil
			labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
			indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to
			them; item, one nech, one chin, and so forth. Were
			you sent hither to praise me?

**Cesario**:	I see you what you are, you are too proud;
			But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
			My lod and master loves you: O, such love
			Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd
			The nonpareil of beauty!

**Olivia**:	How does he love me?

**Cesario**:	With adorations, fertile tears,
			With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.

**Olivia**:	Your lord dies know my mind; I cannot love him:
			Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
			Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
			In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;
			ANd in dimension and the shape of nature
			A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
			He might have took his answer long ago.

**Cesario**:	If I did love you in my master's flame,
			With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
			In you denial I would find no sense;
			I would not understand it.

**Olivia**:	Why, what would you?

**Cesario**:	Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
			And call upon my soul within the house;
			Write loyal cantons of contemned love
			And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
			Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
			And make the babbling gossip of the air
			Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest
			Between the elements of air and earth,
			But you should pity me!

**Olivia**:	You might do much.
			What is your parentage?

**Cesario**:	Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
			I am a gentleman.

**Olivia**:	Get you to your lord;
			I cannot love him: let him send no more;
			Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
			To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
			I thank you for your pains: spend this for me

[Olivia hands Cesario a coin]

**Cesario**:	I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
			My master, not myself, lack recompense.
			Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
			And let your fervor, like my master's, be
			Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.

[Exit]
